## Introduction
<a name="introduction"></a>

For this project, I built machine learning models to predict airplane engine RUL (Remaining Useful Life) and health status. These predictions are valuable as they enable proactive maintenance scheduling, reducing unexpected downtime and maintenance costs. By monitoring engine health, companies can enhance safety and improve overall fleet reliability, leading to increased customer satisfaction and operational efficiency. I trained these models on run-to-failure datasets published by NASA. Run-to-failure datasets are useful for studying the degradation processes of mechanical systems and building models that can help perform prognostics and diagnostics. The models' raw predictions are based on 30 seconds of sensor data, then a running weighted average is applied to provide more accurate and robust final predictions. 

For this project, RUL refers to the number of flight cycles remaining before complete failure, posing a regression prediction task. Health status is a binary classification task, predicting whether the engine is within a normal or abnormal degradation state. This is in reference to NASA's observation that all engines experience two phases of degradation, a phase of normal degradation followed by a phase of abnormal degradation before failure.

Decision tree models are typically a first choice for tabular data. However, decision tree models tend to be ineffective at learning temporal patterns in data. To extract short-term temporal patterns from 30 seconds of sensor data, I developed hybrid models that leverage the strengths of both decision tree machine learning techniques and neural networks. The models are built using one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract features from the sensor data, then those features are used as input for CatBoost models to make their final predictions. I tried various other approaches, such as forms of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), residual network inspired architectures, and using the flattened raw data as input for the decision tree model. However, the hybrid models presented in this project performed with the highest accuracy.  

## Data
<a name="data"></a>
**Database:** [**NASA's Aircraft Engine Run-to-Failure Dataset under Real Flight Conditions for Prognostics and Diagnostics**](https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5729/6/1/5)  
**Original 2020 Paper:** [**Aircraft Engine Run-To-Failure Data Set Under Real Flight Conditions**](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20205001125)

These run-to-failure datasets were synthetically generated using NASA's Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation (C-MAPSS), which simulates turbofan engines with high precision as they are fed flight conditions as recorded by real commercial jets. The variables used to make the predictions include Flight Data (w) and Sensor Measurements (xs). Between these two categories there are 18 features, and each row of data in the dataset represents one second of sensor data.

Each unit (engine) simulated flights of certain lengths and are categorized into three flight classes: short (1 to 3 hour flights), medium (3 to 5 hour flights), and long (5+ hour flights). A variety of flight classes were included to ensure the models would be able to generalize engines from different flight conditions. Below is a table of the 18 units I used to train the models:

| Dataset | Unit | Flight Class |
|--------------|:-------------:|:--------:|
| DS02-006     | 11 | Short |
| DS02-006     | 14 | Medium |
| DS02-006     | 15, 16, 18, 20 | Long |
| DS03-012     | 1, 5, 9, 12 | Short |
| DS03-012     | 2, 3, 4, 7 | Medium |
| DS03-012     | 6, 8, 10, 11 | Long |  

For evaluation, I used units 13 (Long Flight Class), 14 (Short Flight Class), 15 (Medium Flight Class) from DS03-012, to test the models' ability to generalize to different flight classes.

Due to computational constraints, I limited the scope of the project to a subset of engines that experienced a failure mode that affects both the low pressure turbine and the high pressure turbine efficiency. All of the units used in my project experience this specific type of failure mode. With the 18 engines I used for training, it contained over 11 million rows of sensor and flight condition data.  

## Data Preprocessing
<a name="data-preprocessing"></a>
**Code:** [**Preprocessing**](https://github.com/MattPickard/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Turbofan%20Engine%20Prognostics%20Project/preprocessing.ipynb)

The datasets were preprocessed and fully transformed to avoid additional computational overhead during training. The y labels were extracted and the x features were reshaped as (# of samples, 30, 18), representing 30 second windows of 18 features. The 30-second windows were created using overlapping segments with a new window starting every 10 seconds. This process converted approximately 11.5 million seconds of data into 1.15 million 30-second time windows. The 30-second training windows were then randomized and split into training and validation sets, with 10% being used for validation.  

Data Preprocessing Pipeline:

1. Data Extraction and Integration
   - Extract relevant columns from DS02-006 and DS03-012 h5 files
   - Merge into unified dataframe

2. Dataset Partitioning
   - Segregate test units (13, 14, 15 from DS03-012) for final evaluation
   - Remove non-predictive columns (Flight Class and Cycle) as per NASA's intention for models trained on this dataset

3. Temporal Feature Engineering
   - Generate overlapping 30-second windows with 10-second strides
   - Filter out windows spanning multiple units to maintain training integrity
   - Remove unit column which was used for the previous step

4. Training Data Organization
   - Implement random shuffling for robust model training
   - Create training-validation split (90-10)
   - Separate features (x) and target variables (y)

5. Data Persistence
   - Save processed datasets as compressed h5 files for efficient storage and retrieval

Due to the size of the dataset, memory was regularly freed by deleting variables after each transformation step.

## Neural Network Models
<a name="neural-network-models"></a>
**Code:** [**Neural Networks**](https://github.com/MattPickard/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Turbofan%20Engine%20Prognostics%20Project/one_d_conv_models.ipynb)

The first step in assembling the hybrid models involves building one-dimensional convolutional neural networks and using their trained layers as feature extractors. The idea is that while these neural networks train, the first convolutional block learns to extract low-level features. That block is then separated from the larger model and used as feature extractors for a decision tree machine learning model such as CatBoost. As a fun experiment, I also attempted to optimize the neural networks for the two prediction tasks. They do not perform as well as the finished hybrid models, but they showed promise and established a solid baseline of scores for my hybrid models to compare against. Both neural networks shared a similar structure which I found performed well:


- **Input shape:** (30, 18) Thirty seconds of 18 features

- **One-dimensional Convolutional Block**  
    - 1D Convolutional Layer (512 filters, kernel size of 3, strides of 1, relu activation, same padding)  
    - Batch Normalization Layer  
    - Global Average Pooling Layer (I found this worked better than a flattening layer or incremental 1D max pooling layers.)  

- **First Dense Block**  
    - Dense Layer (2048 units, relu activation, L2 kernel regularization of 0.025)  
    - Batch Normalization Layer  

- **Eight Smaller Dense Blocks**  
    - Dense Layer (128 units, relu activation, L2 kernel regularization of 0.025)  
    - Batch Normalization Layer  

- **Output Layers**  
    - Health State uses a sigmoid activation function.  
    - RUL uses a linear activation function.  


To mitigate the likelyhood of learning converging mid-epoch, I lowered the epoch size to check against the validation set more often. To set custom epoch sizes, a data generator was used to feed the models batches of the 30-second windows. For optimizers I used AdamW with an exponential decay learning rate scheduler. This approach allows the learning rate to decrease as the model trains, which promotes more efficient and stable learning. For losses, I used a binary cross-entropy for the health state prediction and a custom loss function for RUL that functions similarly to mean squared error, but penalizes overestimations:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/MattPickard/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Images/custom_loss.png?raw=true" alt="Custom Loss Function" style="width: 50%;">
</p>

The idea behind the custom loss function stems from NASA's evaluation scoring function that slightly penalizes overestimations more than underestimations. This makes sense as overestimations in engine life may lead to delayed maintenance and increased costs. By using this loss function, the RUL model performed better on NASA's scoring function, however, it performed worse on the root mean squared error metric. Therefore, I balanced the performance of the two metrics by using a small penalty weight of .05.

## CatBoost Preprocessing
<a name="catboost-preprocessing"></a>
**Code:** [**CatBoost Preprocessing**](https://github.com/MattPickard/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Turbofan%20Engine%20Prognostics%20Project/catboost_preprocessing.ipynb)

Once the convolutional blocks learned to interpret low-level features, their outputs were used as inputs for CatBoost models. The neural network's first convolutional block takes a shape of (# of samples, 30, 18) as input and outputs a shape of (# of samples, 512). The CatBoost models then use those 512 features to make their predictions. To reduce the computational overhead during training and evaluation, I saved the datasets of features produced by the feature extractors for later use.

## CatBoost Models
<a name="catboost-models"></a>
**Code:** [**CatBoost Models**](https://github.com/MattPickard/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Turbofan%20Engine%20Prognostics%20Project/catboost_models.ipynb)

I began by using grid search cross-validation to find the best parameters for the CatBoost models, however the size of the dataset proved a major challenge, both in terms of memory and computational power. My solution was to use a smaller subset of data during the grid search to gain an intuition for possible best parameters for a model training on the larger dataset. During cross-validation, it became clear that deeper trees performed well, however, to keep the timeline of this project reasonable, I limited the depth of the trees to 10. The final parameters and structure of the models are as follows:

**Health State CatBoost Model:**
- learning rate: 0.1
- depth: 10
- \# of trees: 668
- loss function: Logloss
- Approximate size: 11 MB

**RUL CatBoost Model:**
- learning rate: 0.1
- depth: 10
- \# of trees: 5000
- loss function: RMSE
- Approximate size: 81 MB

## Evaluation
<a name="evaluation"></a>
**Code:** [**Evaluation**](https://github.com/MattPickard/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Turbofan%20Engine%20Prognostics%20Project/evaluation.ipynb)

To create the final predictions from the raw predictions, I applied a running weighted average of 1500 time steps, which is approximately 4 hours. I also applied a threshold of 0.5 to the weighted health state averages to convert the probabilities into a binary classification. Taking these steps make the predictions more robust and accurate.

To evaluate the performance of the models, I tested them on three units of different flight classes. The three units were 13 (Long Flight Class), 14 (Short Flight Class), and 15 (Medium Flight Class) from DS03-012. For evaluation metrics I used accuracy for the health state predictions and three separate metrics for Remaining Useful Life (RUL) predictions: mean absolute error, root mean squared error, and converted NASA's scoring function into an evaluation metric that penalizes overestimations. 

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/MattPickard/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Images/nasa_scoring.png?raw=true" alt="NASA's Evaluation Metric" style="width: 30%;">
</p>

NASA's scoring function is shown above where delta is the difference between the predicted RUL and the actual RUL and alpha is set to 1/13 if the RUL is an underestimate and to 1/10 if the RUL is an overestimate. I converted it into an evaluation metric by taking the mean instead of the sum.

### Evaluation Interpretation

The evaluation results demonstrate significant improvements after applying the final prediction techniques. They also show that the models generalize best to medium flight class engines. This is understandable, as the average flight and engine conditions between the three flight classes most closely resemble the conditions of the medium flight class engines.

## Next Steps   
<a name="next-steps"></a>   
### Create a Diagnostic and Prognostic Suite

The models developed in this project would be great tools for monitoring engine health and optimizing maintenance scheduling. However, they don't diagnose the causes of failure. For a complete diagnostics and prognostics package, I suggest building two additional types of models that would aid in engine diagnostics. First, models that predict the health parameters (theta), which are also simulated by the C-MAPSS models. This would give engineers insight into the efficiency and health of the engine's various components. The health parameters are shown below:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/MattPickard/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Images/health_parameters.png?raw=true" alt="Health Parameters" style="width: 35%;">
</p>

Second, create a multi-class classification model that identifies the type of failure mode. All together, these models would form a diagnostic and prognostic suite that would help engineers diagnose the causes of failure, perform proper maintenance, and schedule maintenance.

### Diversify and Scale Up the Data

While this project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in engine prognostics, it currently focuses on a single failure mode. To achieve industry-ready performance, the models would need to be trained on a comprehensive dataset encompassing all possible failure modes. Additionally, expanding the training dataset would increase the diversity of flight and engine conditions the model has to learn from, likely enhancing the models' ability to generalize across different flight classes.

### Model Improvements

There are multiple approaches still worth exploring to improve the models' performance: 

- Explore deeper decision tree architectures in the CatBoost models beyond the current depth limit of 10, which was chosen for computational efficiency during initial development.
- Implement advanced feature engineering techniques, including:
  - Domain-specific engineered features
  - Aggregated features like rolling averages and lag indicators
  - Cross-model feature integration, using health state predictions to inform RUL predictions and vice versa
- Investigate alternative architectural approaches:
  - Transformer-based feature extractors to better capture temporal dependencies
  - Evaluation of other gradient boosting frameworks to complement or replace CatBoost
- Scale up training data volume to enhance model generalization capabilities across different flight conditions and engine states

## Conclusion
<a name="conclusion"></a>

This project highlights how tools that aid in predictive maintenance and diagnostics can be built using machine learning. By leveraging sensor data and combining one-dimensional convolutional neural networks with advanced machine learning models like CatBoost, robust models capable of useful predictions and classifications of mechanical systems can be built. These predictions allow engineers to proactively identify and address potential issues, reducing unexpected downtime and extending the operational lifespan of engines. This enhances safety and reliability and translates into cost reductions and operational efficiency. I hope you enjoyed, please reach out if you have any questions or comments!
