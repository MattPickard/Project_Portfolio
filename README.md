In this repository, you will find a collection of my data science and machine learning projects. I hope you find them useful and interesting!

# Projects

## **Querying my Grandfather's Memoir with RAG Pipelines ([Link](https://github.com/MattPickard/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Memior%20RAG%20Project))**

###### **Tags:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Natural Language Processing (NLP), Reranking, Context Enrichment, Information Retrieval, LangChain, Microsoft GraphRAG, OpenAI API, Query Rewriting, Prompt Engineering

In this project, I demonstrate the application of various RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) techniques, creating a pipeline that answers questions about my grandfather's memoir. These techniques are often used in the natural language processing and information retrieval applications. The findings reveal how enhancements like reranking and context enrichment through an ensemble approach can significantly improve retrieval success rates.


## **Turbofan Engine Prognostics Models ([Link](https://github.com/MattPickard/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Turbofan%20Engine%20Prognostics%20Project))**

###### **Tags:** Convolutional Neural Networks, CatBoost, Big Data, Regression and Binary Classification, Engine Prognostics, TensorFlow/Keras, Preprocessing, Cross-Validation, Feature Extraction, Data Visualization

This project utilizes a NASA run-to-failure dataset to develop hybrid models that predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) and health status of turbofan engines. By integrating one-dimensional convolutional neural networks with CatBoost models, this approach effectively captures the temporal patterns present in sensor data. The resulting predictions serve as valuable tools for engineers, enabling proactive maintenance scheduling and monitoring engine health.

## **Loan Fraud Detection ([Link](https://github.com/MattPickard/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Loan%20Fraud%20Detection%20Project))**

###### **Tags:** Fraud Detection, Feature Engineering, Imbalanced Learning, SMOTENC, Optuna Hyperparameter Tuning, Feature Importance, LightGBM

This project provides a practical machine learning framework for financial institutions to detect fraudulent loan applications while minimizing false positives that could impact legitimate customers. The solution employs a mixed sampling strategy combining SMOTENC and random undersampling to address class imbalance, along with comprehensive feature engineering including log scaling, robust scaling, and one-hot encoding. The LightGBM model, optimized through Optuna hyperparameter tuning, achieves performance on par with academic research, with velocity-based features and temporal metrics emerging as the most influential predictors.
